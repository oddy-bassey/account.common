# Account.Common

This project is a simple Java Library for my ZuBank Application. It provides definition for classes
which are shared amongst the bank modules (account.cmd, account.query and transaction) <br>
These shared classes are:
* dto : these contain data transfer objects  
* event : these contain events (occurring events after associative action has been performed) classes for account and transaction
* exception : It contains custom exceptions thrown within modules
